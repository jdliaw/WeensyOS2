Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Cooperative scheduling that mimics Round Robin.


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: (320 * 4) - 3 = 1280 - 3 = 1277 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 320 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 0 ms 
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: (0 + (320 - 2) + (640 - 3) + (960 - 4)) / 4 = 477.75 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit? Exercise 4A.


Exercise 5:

First known timer interrupt occurs in Process 1. The first anomaly is found in the first line 
where one of the Process 1 characters is missing. This indicates that a clock interrupt happened 
during the execution of Process 1, in which the CPU will stop running the process and transfer 
control to the kernel.
